# WebSocket

Allow us to set communication where clients connect to a server. Here are some of the things that WebSockets allow us:

- Allow full-duplex(bidirectional) communication. The client can initiate communication with the client and vice-versa different that an `HTTP` request that only the client initiates the communication also the WebSocket is present along with as is needed.
- WebSocket is a separate protocol from `HTTP`
- Persistent connection between client and server
